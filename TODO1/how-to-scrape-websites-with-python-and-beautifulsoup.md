# 如何使用 Python 和 BeautifulSoup 抓取网站

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BrUAg3-OqIHkoTz_CRIzTA.png)

互联网上的信息比任何人在一生中都能吸收的信息更多。您需要的不是访问该信息，而是一种收集，组织和分析信息的可扩展方式。

你需要网络抓取。

Web抓取自动提取数据并以您可以轻松理解的格式呈现。在本教程中，我们将重点关注其在金融市场中的应用，但网络抓取可用于各种情况。

如果你是一个狂热的投资者，每天获得收盘价可能会很痛苦，特别是当你需要的信息在几个网页上找到时。我们将通过构建Web scraper来自动从Internet检索股票指数，从而简化数据提取。

### 入门

We将使用Python作为我们的拼写语言，以及一个简单而强大的库BeautifulSoup。

 *对于Mac用户，Python预安装在OS X中。打开终端并输入`python --version`。你应该看到你的python版本是2.7.x.
 *对于Windows用户，请通过[官方网站](https://www.python.org/downloads/)安装Python。

Next我们需要使用`pip`来获取BeautifulSoup库，这是一个Python的包管理工具。

在终端中输入：

```
easy_install pip  
pip install BeautifulSoup4
```

**注意**：如果您未能执行上述命令行，请尝试在每行前面添加`sudo`。

### 基础知识

Before we start jumping into the code, let’s understand the basics of HTML and some rules of scraping.

**HTML tags**  
If you already understand HTML tags, feel free to skip this part.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1> First Scraping </h1>
        <p> Hello World </p>
    <body>
</html>
```

This is the basic syntax of an HTML webpage. Every `<tag>` serves a block inside the webpage:  
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: HTML documents must start with a type declaration.  
2. The HTML document is contained between `<html>` and `</html>`.  
3. The meta and script declaration of the HTML document is between `<head>` and `</head>`.  
4. The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>` tags.  
5. Title headings are defined with the `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags.  
6. Paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag.

Other useful tags include `<a>` for hyperlinks, `<table>` for tables, `<tr>` for table rows, and `<td>` for table columns.

Also, HTML tags sometimes come with `id` or `class` attributes. The `id` attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML tag and the value must be unique within the HTML document. The `class` attribute is used to define equal styles for HTML tags with the same class. We can make use of these ids and classes to help us locate the data we want.

For more information on HTML [tags](http://www.w3schools.com/html/), [id](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_id.asp) and [class](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp), please refer to W3Schools [Tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/).

**Scraping Rules**

1.  You should check a website’s Terms and Conditions before you scrape it. Be careful to read the statements about legal use of data. Usually, the data you scrape should not be used for commercial purposes.
2.  Do not request data from the website too aggressively with your program (also known as spamming), as this may break the website. Make sure your program behaves in a reasonable manner (i.e. acts like a human). One request for one webpage per second is good practice.
3.  The layout of a website may change from time to time, so make sure to revisit the site and rewrite your code as needed

### Inspecting the Page

Let’s take one page from the [Bloomberg Quote](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPX:IND) website as an example.

As someone following the stock market, we would like to get the index name (S&P 500) and its price from this page. First, right-click and open your browser’s inspector to inspect the webpage.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*KOJCuAYQyMIC8QdQyXERyw.png)

Try hovering your cursor on the price and you should be able to see a blue box surrounding it. If you click it, the related HTML will be selected in the browser console.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*T0t6G2tawfTtKHR4yY_iVQ.png)

From the result, we can see that the price is inside a few levels of HTML tags, which is `<div class="basic-quote">` → `<div class="price-container up">` → `<div class="price">`.

Similarly, if you hover and click the name “S&P 500 Index”, it is inside `<div class="basic-quote">` and `<h1 class="name">`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ga5bmPtLDdWUTvL-pNxBgg.png)

Now we know the unique location of our data with the help of `class` tags.

### Jump into the Code

Now that we know where our data is, we can start coding our web scraper. Open your text editor now!

First, we need to import all the libraries that we are going to use.

```
# import libraries
import urllib2
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

Next, declare a variable for the url of the page.

```
# specify the url
quote_page = ‘http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPX:IND'
```

Then, make use of the Python urllib2 to get the HTML page of the url declared.

```
# query the website and return the html to the variable ‘page’
page = urllib2.urlopen(quote_page)
```

Finally, parse the page into BeautifulSoup format so we can use BeautifulSoup to work on it.

```
# parse the html using beautiful soup and store in variable `soup`
soup = BeautifulSoup(page, ‘html.parser’)
```

Now we have a variable, `soup`, containing the HTML of the page. Here’s where we can start coding the part that extracts the data.

Remember the unique layers of our data? BeautifulSoup can help us get into these layers and extract the content with `find()`. In this case, since the HTML class `name` is unique on this page, we can simply query `<div class="name">`.

```
# Take out the <div> of name and get its value
name_box = soup.find(‘h1’, attrs={‘class’: ‘name’})
```

After we have the tag, we can get the data by getting its `text`.

```
name = name_box.text.strip() # strip() is used to remove starting and trailing
print name
```

Similarly, we can get the price too.

```
# get the index price
price_box = soup.find(‘div’, attrs={‘class’:’price’})
price = price_box.text
print price
```

When you run the program, you should be able to see that it prints out the current price of the S&P 500 Index.

### Export to Excel CSV

Now that we have the data, it is time to save it. The Excel Comma Separated Format is a nice choice. It can be opened in Excel so you can see the data and process it easily.

But first, we have to import the Python csv module and the datetime module to get the record date. Insert these lines to your code in the import section.

```
import csv
from datetime import datetime
```

At the bottom of your code, add the code for writing data to a csv file.

```
# open a csv file with append, so old data will not be erased
with open(‘index.csv’, ‘a’) as csv_file:
 writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
 writer.writerow([name, price, datetime.now()])
```

Now if you run your program, you should able to export an `index.csv` file, which you can then open with Excel, where you should see a line of data.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d-27jLzy2GrxmvlLRJ4yVw.png)

So if you run this program everyday, you will be able to easily get the S&P 500 Index price without rummaging through the website!

### Going Further (Advanced uses)

**Multiple Indices**  
So scraping one index is not enough for you, right? We can try to extract multiple indices at the same time.

First, modify the `quote_page` into an array of URLs.

```
quote_page = [‘http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPX:IND', ‘http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CCMP:IND']
```

Then we change the data extraction code into a `for` loop, which will process the URLs one by one and store all the data into a variable `data` in tuples.

```
# for loop
data = []
for pg in quote_page:
 # query the website and return the html to the variable ‘page’
 page = urllib2.urlopen(pg)

# parse the html using beautiful soap and store in variable `soup`
 soup = BeautifulSoup(page, ‘html.parser’)

# Take out the <div> of name and get its value
 name_box = soup.find(‘h1’, attrs={‘class’: ‘name’})
 name = name_box.text.strip() # strip() is used to remove starting and trailing

# get the index price
 price_box = soup.find(‘div’, attrs={‘class’:’price’})
 price = price_box.text

# save the data in tuple
 data.append((name, price))
```

Also, modify the saving section to save data row by row.

```
# open a csv file with append, so old data will not be erased
with open(‘index.csv’, ‘a’) as csv_file:
 writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
 # The for loop
 for name, price in data:
 writer.writerow([name, price, datetime.now()])
```

Rerun the program and you should be able to extract two indices at the same time!

### Advanced Scraping Techniques

BeautifulSoup is simple and great for small-scale web scraping. But if you are interested in scraping data at a larger scale, you should consider using these other alternatives:

1.  [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/), a powerful python scraping framework
2.  Try to integrate your code with some public APIs. The efficiency of data retrieval is much higher than scraping webpages. For example, take a look at [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api), which can help you get hidden data which is not shown on Facebook webpages.
3.  Consider using a database backend like [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to store your data when it gets too large.

### Adopt the DRY Method

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gD4GwO1zV33IIgoeYLVrzA.jpeg)

DRY stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself”, try to automate your everyday tasks like [this person](http://www.businessinsider.com/programmer-automates-his-job-2015-11). Some other fun projects to consider might be keeping track of your Facebook friends’ active time (with their consent of course), or grabbing a list of topics in a forum and trying out natural language processing (which is a hot topic for Artificial Intelligence right now)!
